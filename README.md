# Transcription Exercises

Given an mp3 file and a correct transcript, prompt the user to listen to a sentence and attempt to transcribe it.

The user will then be given the opportunity to save their work and compare it to the correct answer.  Or maybe just get a hint.

Eventually, this will somehow be merged with the transcribe project, which uses automated transcription and then asks someone to correct it.
